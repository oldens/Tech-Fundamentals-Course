# Lesson 1: What is Machine Learning?

## Topics
- Definition of ML
- Types of tasks (classification, regression, clustering)
- Key terms (features, labels, model, training)
- Applications of ML
- Problem formulation

## Notes
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data and improve their performance over time.

### Types of Tasks
1. **Classification**: Assigning inputs to predefined categories or classes.
2. **Regression**: Predicting continuous values based on input data.
3. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together without predefined labels.

### Key Terms
- **Features**: Individual measurable properties or characteristics of the data.
- **Labels**: The output or target variable that the model aims to predict.
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of the relationship between features and labels.
- **Training**: The process of teaching the model to make predictions by feeding it data.

### Applications of ML
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
- Fraud detection
- Personalized recommendations

### Problem Formulation
To effectively apply ML, it is crucial to define the problem clearly, identify the relevant features, and select appropriate algorithms and evaluation metrics.
