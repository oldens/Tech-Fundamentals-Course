## Topics
- Working with a ready-made template
- Customization
- Deployment on GitHub Pages (preliminary introduction)

## Notes
In this lesson, we will focus on quickly creating a website using a ready-made template, customizing it to fit our needs, and deploying it on GitHub Pages.

### Working with a Ready-Made Template
Using a ready-made template can significantly speed up the development process. Templates provide a pre-designed structure and style, allowing you to focus on content and customization.

#### Steps to Use a Template
1. **Choose a Template**: Select a template that fits your needs. There are many free and paid templates available online.
2. **Download the Template**: Download the template files to your local machine.
3. **Open the Template**: Open the template files in your preferred code editor.
4. **Understand the Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the structure of the template, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

### Customization
Customization involves modifying the template to match your specific requirements. This can include changing text, images, colors, and layout.

#### Steps to Customize a Template
1. **Edit HTML**: Modify the HTML content to include your own text, images, and links.
2. **Edit CSS**: Adjust the CSS to change the appearance of the website, such as colors, fonts, and spacing.
3. **Edit JavaScript**: If the template includes JavaScript, you can modify it to add or change functionality.

### Deployment on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It is an excellent way to quickly deploy and share your website.

#### Steps to Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. **Create a Repository**: Create a new repository on GitHub for your website.
2. **Push Your Code**: Push the template files and your customizations to the repository.
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**: In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the branch to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`).
4. **Access Your Website**: Once GitHub Pages is enabled, your website will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

### Practice: Creating and Publishing a Simple Portfolio Website
As a practical exercise, create a simple portfolio website using a ready-made template. Customize the template to include your own information, and deploy the website on GitHub Pages.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a live website that you can share with others.
