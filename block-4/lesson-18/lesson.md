# Lesson 18: Version Control: Git and GitHub

## Topics
- Importance of VCS
- Git: init, add, commit, push, pull
- Working with GitHub repositories
- Publishing pages

## Notes
Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential tools for developers to manage changes to source code over time. Git is one of the most popular VCS, and GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories.

### Importance of VCS
VCS allows developers to:
- Track changes to code
- Collaborate with others
- Revert to previous versions
- Manage multiple versions of a project

### Git Commands
1. **init**: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. **add**: Adds changes to the staging area.
3. **commit**: Records changes to the repository.
4. **push**: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
5. **pull**: Fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.

### Working with GitHub Repositories
GitHub provides a platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. Key features include:
- Repository creation and management
- Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests)
- Code review and discussion

### Publishing Pages
GitHub Pages allows users to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Steps to publish a page:
1. Create a repository with the desired content.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
3. Access the published site via the provided URL.

By understanding and utilizing Git and GitHub, developers can effectively manage their code and collaborate with others.
