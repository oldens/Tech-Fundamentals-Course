## Notes
In this lesson, we will cover some advanced features of Python that are useful for various applications, including data serialization, pattern matching, database interactions, and web development.

### Serialization (Pickle)
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. In Python, the `pickle` module is used for serializing and deserializing objects. For example:

```python
import pickle

# Serializing an object
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
with open('data.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(data, file)

# Deserializing an object
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(file)
    print(loaded_data)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
```

### Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation. The `re` module in Python provides support for working with regular expressions. For example:

```python
import re

# Searching for a pattern in a string
pattern = r'\d+'
text = 'There are 123 apples and 456 oranges.'
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)  # Output: ['123', '456']
```

### Basics of Working with Databases
Python provides various libraries for interacting with databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. The `sqlite3` module is included in the standard library and allows for working with SQLite databases. For example:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connecting to a database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)''')

# Inserting data into the table
cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25)''')
conn.commit()

# Querying data from the table
cursor.execute('''SELECT * FROM users''')
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)

# Closing the connection
conn.close()
```

### Basics of Web Development in Python
Python is widely used for web development, and there are several frameworks available, such as Flask and Django. Flask is a lightweight web framework that is easy to get started with. For example:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

By understanding these advanced features of Python, you can enhance your programming skills and apply them to various real-world applications.
