# Lesson 25: Ethereum and Smart Contracts

## Topics
- Differences from Bitcoin
- Account model
- Concept and capabilities of smart contracts
- EVM

## Notes
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It differs from Bitcoin in several key aspects, including its account model and the capabilities of its smart contracts.

### Differences from Bitcoin
1. **Purpose**: While Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is a platform for building decentralized applications.
2. **Account Model**: Ethereum uses an account-based model, whereas Bitcoin uses a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model.
3. **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum supports smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

### Account Model
In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts:
1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)**: Controlled by private keys and used by individuals to send and receive Ether (ETH) and interact with smart contracts.
2. **Contract Accounts**: Represent smart contracts and are controlled by code. They can execute code, store data, and interact with other contracts and EOAs.

### Concept and Capabilities of Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute and enforce the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts can:
- Facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.
- Automate complex processes and transactions.
- Interact with other smart contracts and decentralized applications.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized computing environment that executes smart contracts. It provides a runtime environment for smart contracts and ensures that they are executed consistently across all nodes in the Ethereum network. The EVM is Turing-complete, meaning it can execute any computation that can be described algorithmically.

By understanding the differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin, the account model, the concept and capabilities of smart contracts, and the role of the EVM, we can appreciate the potential of Ethereum as a platform for building decentralized applications.
