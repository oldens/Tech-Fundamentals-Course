# Lesson 24: Basics of Blockchain and Bitcoin

## Topics
- Decentralization
- Cryptography (hashes, signatures)
- Consensus
- Bitcoin structure

## Notes
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. It ensures the security and integrity of data through cryptographic techniques.

### Decentralization
Decentralization refers to the distribution of authority, functions, and data across multiple nodes in a network, rather than relying on a single central entity. This enhances security, transparency, and resilience.

### Cryptography
Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, which can only be deciphered by authorized parties. In blockchain, cryptographic techniques such as hashes and digital signatures are used to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

#### Hashes
A hash is a fixed-size alphanumeric string generated from input data of any size. It is unique to the input data and any change in the input will result in a completely different hash. Hashes are used to secure data and ensure its integrity.

#### Digital Signatures
Digital signatures are cryptographic techniques that provide proof of authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. They are used to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the message has not been altered.

### Consensus
Consensus is the process by which nodes in a blockchain network agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the ledger. Various consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), are used to achieve consensus in blockchain networks.

### Bitcoin Structure
Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency that operates on a decentralized blockchain network. The structure of Bitcoin includes the following components:

1. **Blocks**: Containers that hold batches of transactions. Each block is linked to the previous block, forming a chain.
2. **Transactions**: Records of the transfer of bitcoins between addresses.
3. **Addresses**: Unique identifiers used to send and receive bitcoins.
4. **Mining**: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to create new blocks and are rewarded with bitcoins.

By understanding the basics of blockchain and Bitcoin, we can appreciate the significance of decentralized technologies and their potential impact on various industries.
